# BASSic

The BASSic is an accesible bass guitar for people with osteoarthritis. Musical instruments are often recommended as a good therapy treatment for people with arthritis. However, as the disease advances, current instruments become too painful to play. One of the main causes is the weight of the instruments and the required range of motion. Additionally, musical instruments are often expensive. The BASSic aims to solve all these problems!

The BASSic is ergonomic and meets the user needs of people with osteoarthritis. It is very lightweight and it does not require complicating and painful string plucking. Instead, a touch sensitive interface replaces the common strings. Additionally, it uses the power of Teensy and the MIDI communication protocol to simulate the bass music sounds, making it extremely affordable!
